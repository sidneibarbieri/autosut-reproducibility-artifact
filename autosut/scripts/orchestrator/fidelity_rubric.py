"""Fidelity rubric adopted from the frozen predecessor methodology.

The frozen predecessor artifact introduces a 5-question rubric for classifying
each technique execution as
``faithful`` / ``adapted`` / ``inspired``. AutoSUT adopts the same rubric for
methodological parity, with the same decision logic, and applies it against
:class:`TechniqueOutcome` records produced by our orchestrator.

The rubric questions
--------------------

- **Q1** Was the central mechanism of the technique preserved?
- **Q2** Was the relevant substrate (OS / runtime / service) preserved?
- **Q3** Did the required preconditions arise operationally (not pre-staged)?
- **Q4** Does the observed effect follow from the mechanism, not a semantic shortcut?
- **Q5** Can the evidence be independently audited and verified?

Decision logic (identical to frozen ``fidelity_rubric.py``)
-----------------------------------------------------------

- All five yes → ``faithful``
- Q1 + Q2 + Q4 yes (lab usually has Q3 = no) → ``adapted``
- Q1 yes + Q2 partial + Q4 partial → ``adapted`` (borderline)
- Otherwise → ``inspired``

Lab note
--------

The frozen rubric forces Q3 to ``False`` for every lab execution because
preconditions (credentials, vulnerable services, staged files) are configured
by the SUT profile rather than discovered operationally. AutoSUT preserves
this honesty principle: a campaign that drives a *real CVE chain* with no
pre-staging (a rare and explicitly-tagged class) is the only path to
``faithful``.

Independent audit (Q5) is uniformly ``True`` for AutoSUT executions because
every outcome has a per-technique log path, and Caldera-driven outcomes have
``operation_id`` / ``link_id`` / ``ability_id`` cross-referenceable against
the live Caldera DB.
