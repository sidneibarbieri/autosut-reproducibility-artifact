"""Abstract execution-substrate backend for one campaign run.

AutoSUT separates **orchestration semantics** (tuple, manifest, fidelity
rubric, Caldera dispatch) from **execution substrate** (container, VM,
hypervisor). The orchestrator only requires the contract defined here, so
the same campaign can be executed on:

- :class:`DockerEnvironment` — canonical, portable, reviewer-friendly.
- :class:`QEMUEnvironment` — extended realism, real kernel boundary, full
  ARM64 Linux VM via Vagrant + QEMU (parity with the frozen
  ``sticks/Vagrantfile``).
- :class:`TartEnvironment` *(optional, experimental)* — Apple Silicon
  fast-path via Virtualization.framework. Never the canonical
  recommendation per artifact-evaluation guidance (avoid the
  "Apple-only artifact" critique).

This module defines the abstract contract. Each concrete backend is in its
own module so reviewers can audit them independently.
