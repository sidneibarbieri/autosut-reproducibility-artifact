class FidelityLevel(str, Enum):
    """Technique execution fidelity — three-tier taxonomy.

    AutoSUT adopts the three-tier vocabulary used by the frozen STICKS
    artifact and the 5-question rubric in :mod:`fidelity_rubric` decides the
    tier for each technique execution.

    - ``faithful``: the central mechanism, the substrate (OS/runtime/service),
      the operational preconditions, the observed effect, AND the auditable
      evidence trail all line up with what a real adversary would produce.
      Q3 (preconditions arose operationally, not pre-staged) is hard to
      satisfy in a controlled lab, so this tier is reserved for the rare
      execution where the pre-staging step itself is automated and the
      ability is dispatched via a canonical tool (e.g., Caldera ART against
      a real vulnerable build).
    - ``adapted``: the technique sequence runs with a realistic mechanism
      (real certificate, real DB query, real RCE against the actual or a
      semantically-equivalent surrogate service). The attacker observes the
      same protocol/state changes a real adversary would, but at least one
      precondition was pre-staged.
    - ``inspired``: the technique is exercised at the *concept* level only.
      No specific protocol or product is invoked; the run records that the
      attacker performed the conceptual action against a generic primitive.

    The frozen artifact ships this taxonomy but in practice scores **zero
    faithful** across all 10 campaigns it ships rubric data for — its lab
    constraints force Q3 to False. AutoSUT keeps the tier in the vocabulary
    so the manifest can declare/report against the canonical taxonomy and
    so future executions that genuinely satisfy Q3 (e.g., a real CVE attack
    chain with no pre-staging) can claim faithful honestly.
