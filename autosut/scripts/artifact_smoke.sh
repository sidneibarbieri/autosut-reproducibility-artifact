# Artifact-evaluation smoke test (~5 minutes).
#
# Demonstrates four things in sequence:
#
#   1. The release gate is green on a fresh checkout (all 7 contracts pass).
#   2. The orchestrator can re-execute the canonical CVE-real reference
#      campaign end-to-end (0.cve_2021_41773 — Apache 2.4.49 path traversal),
#      producing fresh evidence under release/evidence/.
#   3. The curator promotes the freshly produced run as the canonical
#      evidence entry for that campaign without disturbing the other entries.
#   4. The release gate is still green after the re-curation.
#
# Exit code 0 means the artifact is functional. Anything else surfaces the
# failed contract verbatim.
#
# Usage (from project root)::
