"""Concurrent campaign execution runner.

Where the frozen ``sticks/scripts/run_all_lab_campaigns.py`` runs every
campaign sequentially through a shared 3-VM stack (the docstring on its
line 3 reads "Sequential VM-backed batch runner"), AutoSUT can dispatch
multiple campaigns concurrently. Each campaign owns its own per-run
container (or container fleet on its own private Docker network), so
there is no shared substrate to serialize on. Caldera is shared, but
operations are per-paw so concurrent dispatch is safe.

This runner is the architectural proof of that capability: it accepts a
list of campaign IDs and a maximum concurrency, executes them in
parallel, and writes a TSV summary identical in shape to the frozen
batch output so the comparison is direct.

Usage::
